          <p>Im Emma, a web developer from London. I left my job as Commercial Manager at Universal Music to re-train as a developer by enrolling in the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly in March 2019. I absolutely loved my time at General Assembly and have relished the opportunity to develop my problem-solving skills and curiosity in code. I canâ€™t wait to devote the next phase of my life to a career as a developer.</p>
